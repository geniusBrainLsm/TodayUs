## Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
- `lib/nickname_input_screen.dart` - Main nickname input screen
- `lib/services/nickname_service.dart` - Service for managing nickname data

### Modified Files:
- `lib/main.dart` - Added nickname input route and updated home page
- `lib/login_screen.dart` - Added navigation logic for first-time users
- `test/widget_test.dart` - Fixed test to work with new app structure

## Features

### Nickname Input Screen
- **Animated Interface**: Smooth fade and slide animations matching the login screen design
- **Real-time Validation**: 
  - 2-10 character length requirement
  - Only Korean, English letters, numbers, and underscores allowed
  - Visual feedback with error messages
- **User Experience**:
  - Visual confirmation icons for valid/invalid input
  - Loading state during save operation
  - Skip option for users who want to set nickname later
- **Consistent Design**: Matches the existing app's gradient background and styling

### Navigation Flow
- **First-time Users**: Login → Nickname Input → Home
- **Returning Users**: Login → Home (direct)
- **Guest Users**: Login (Browse) → Nickname Input → Home

### Data Management
- Uses SharedPreferences for local storage
- Tracks whether user has set their nickname (`nickname_set` flag)
- Stores the actual nickname (`user_nickname`)
- Service class provides clean API for nickname operations

## Usage

### Setting Up Nickname
1. User logs in for the first time
2. System checks if nickname is already set
3. If not set, navigates to nickname input screen
4. User enters nickname (validated in real-time)
5. User can either save nickname or skip
6. Navigates to home screen

### Home Screen Integration
- Displays personalized greeting with user's nickname
- Shows nickname in app bar if available
- Provides logout functionality that clears nickname data

## Technical Implementation

### Validation Rules
```dart
// Nickname validation in NicknameService
- Minimum 2 characters
- Maximum 10 characters  
- Pattern: ^[가-힣a-zA-Z0-9_]+$
- No special characters except underscore
```

### State Management
- Uses StatefulWidget with local state
- SharedPreferences for persistence
- Service layer for business logic separation

### Error Handling
- Network error handling (for future API integration)
- Input validation with user-friendly messages
- Graceful fallbacks for edge cases

## Future Enhancements
- Backend API integration for nickname availability checking
- Social login nickname pre-population
- Nickname change functionality in user settings
- Profile picture integration with nickname display
